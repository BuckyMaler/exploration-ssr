# Exploration Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Exploration SSR is my first hurrah to learning server-side rendering with React. If you're new to server-side rendering this may be a helpful resource for you. Its purpose is to be educational. It's a collection of apps (only two now, but more to come!) demonstrating how to build the [Unsplash homepage](https://unsplash.com/) using server-side rendering.

Learn with me by fixing a bug or [starting a discussion](https://github.com/BuckyMaler/exploration-ssr/discussions). To keep this project in the scope of a beginner friendly educational resource, feature submissions won't be accepted.
